<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About call history

If you're having trouble converting call logs into time entries, our call history app can help streamline the process. Simply go to your Teams calls list, select all with `Ctrl + A`, copy the content using `Ctrl + C`, and paste it into the `teams-call.txt` file located in your desktop folder. Our app will then efficiently convert this data into time entries, saving you time and effort in managing your team's call log information.
